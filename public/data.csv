You ride past the half dressed soldier at the gate and park the bike in the compound.,2
A guard informs you a young boy accidentally wandered into the perimeter and they have him inside.,"3,4"
Talk to the boy,8
"Talk to him later, you need to hear the daily briefing.",5
"The brief was nothing different than yesterday. More supply chains have been dismantled, another spy captured, low on meds, it's getting progressively worse every passing day.",6
A few hundred soldiers are looking up to you for guidance as everything around you crumbles to the ground.,7
You're informed the boy is giving the guards a hard time.,3
You ask the boy why he walked 50 miles away from the city and walked past our security fence.,9
"He begins to cry and says he was trying to find the house of his grand father, he found the coordinates from the exif data of an old photo gallery.",10
"You donâ€™t think too much of it, the global intelligence agency has been known to use little children implanted with sensors as spies.","11,12"
Ask if he knows who we are,16
"You can't trust him, he might be transmitting this back to GIA. Execute him.",13
"As you turn and leave the roomyou hear him screaming as he is carried away. Part of you wondering if you made the right choice,",14
He could have been the next revolutionary.,15
Sir I hate to interrupt but the delta scout team has returned with some observations you need to see.,38
"He says he has no idea what this is, he was expecting an old house where his grandfather lived.",17
You realize this is your grandson.,"18,19"
"Keep his innocence, share some supplies and send him back home",20
Explain to him you're a patriot.,22
You give him some rations and tell him to never speak of this day. Tell the Police you got lost in the woods.,21
As he leaves you begin to regret not explaining what you were doing out here.,14
"Kid, we are the few people in the world that still call ourselves Patriots.",23
"Long before the globalist state we live in today, there were divided regions of the world called countries.",24
He asks what happened to them,"18,25"
Tell the truth.,26
"Well, it all started where many of the soldiers in this compound come from, America.",27
"A national mass surveillance program was established to collect, sort and categorize every citizen in the country.",28
Similar to the OVERSIGHT program we have today but the version back then was much less sophisticated.,29
"One night though, it went from pure surveillance to war on the citizens. The president made an executive order revoking the bill of rights, permitting the use of drone strikes against targets within the country and declaring himself along with the military commanders rulers of the country.",30
"They used the drones to target all members of their democratic congress, and citizens who had a 50% or greater chance of rebelling based on data collected by the mass surveillance program.",31
Within the coming months they merged with the European Union and carpet bombed all countries that refused to comply with the new globalist state.,32
"Countries like China, Russia and the entire Middle Eastern region were nuked so much it nearly put the entire planet into a nuclear winter for an entire decade.",33
"We are the few people left that refused to comply. We started off fighting for our country's independence, thats where the term patriot came from.",34
"Eventually though, our numbers became so small we had to join forces. The few hundred people in this compound are the only Patriots left.",35
Gov. mandated brain interfaces installed in all young men & women make it impossible for us to recruit new members.,36
Fighting back is almost impossible considering we still use guns with actual bullets.,37
Our time to revolt is running out,86
Go to the command center,39
The observations aren't good. The Counter Insurgency force has beefed up security around our planned entry points for the upcoming operation.,40
This is problematic because the OP is running on a strict time table. Members of the world congress only pass through NYC once every year. We might not even be around next year.,"41,42,43"
Abort the operation.,44
Continue with the operation as planned.,45
Pick new entry points and continue with the operation.,45
The generals inform you aborting this could result in a loss of already low morale. We must carry this mission out.,"42,43"
2 DAYS LATER,46
"The first radio transmission comes in, something was scrambling it's signal, but we were able to make out a few words, including ambush.",47
Some photos were also transmitted back over the Sat. uplink. You recognize something from the post battle shots.,48
Then it slowly hits you.,49
"It's the remains of the boy, your grandson.",50
He must have followed the assault squad...,51
3 DAYS LATER,52
Your generals have devised a counter attack directly on the counter insurgency unit's HQ. They strongly suggest hitting it now while most of the units are on city perimeter patrol instead of working in HQ.,"53,54"
Execute the plan.,55
"Reject it, we don't have the resources.",56
"A drone spotted the assault force while en route, they were all KIA.",57
Word gets out about the plan being rejected. Several patriots decide to split off because they are losing faith in you.,57
1 WEEK LATER,58
The only hacker we have left found a critical vulnerability in the citizen brain interfaces.,59
The remote execution could in theory remove the brainwashing neurons from millions of citizens.,"60,61"
Do a small scale test first and see what happens.,62
"Use the hack on the entire population, small scale test could set off an alarm which causes them to patch the vulnerability.",63
"You sucessfully uplink the virus to a few citizens, however it encounters a null pointer error when trying to execute and doesn't work.",65
Using the virus at this scale causes it to crash unexpectedly. The brain interface was not designed for this type of usage and also crashes.,64
This kills several thousand innocent people by literally shutting down their brain.,65
"To make matters worse, the signal used to uplink the virus was traced. It's only a matter of time before the military drops antimatter bombs within a 50 mile radius of the compound.","66,67"
Head into the bunkers and setup the AA we have left. We won't be able to run anywhere they can't find us.,68
Pack everything essential and bug out. We can't win a direct confrontation with the military.,78
"All essential personal quickly filed into the bunkers, but the AA defenses failed to start.",69
"Without those we had no chance of survival, you order everyone out of the bunkers and to get away from the compound, leaving almost everything behind.",70
"With such a late start, we had no chance and the military is nearly right above our heads.","71,72"
"Surrender, we can't outrun their ion engines.",73
"Split up, reduce the chances we all die.",79
"Gunships quickly swarm around your squad and open fire, ignoring your white flags.",74
"You managed to take cover, but nobody else was able to.",75
There is a good chance you are the last patriot left on the planet.,76
"The only people left who know anything about countries, how the world used to be and don't have brain interfaces are the old men sitting in congress.",77
"Write a formal letter to the world congress, declaring you surrender and state what you were fighting for.",
You've managed to get a few km from the compound but you spot the first bomber planes.,"71,72"
1 DAY LATER,80
"I think we're the last squad left, I honestly have no idea. We've dropped most of our gear and haven't stopped running.",81
"We changed directions and started moving towards the city, they wouldn't risk bombing near it.",82
1 Day Later,83
"We can see the city outskirts, but a patrol drone has probably already picked up our heat signature.","84,77"
Get the guys ready for our last stand.,85
"Outgunned and numbered, they all die within minutes.",75
"Anyway kid, it's dangerous out here, you need to head back home",15
